# RED-ML.V1.1(The updated version of RED-ML)

# Description

In this version of RED-ML,we only alter the coefficients of features.But in the detection of RNA editing sites,this part is most important.This will determine accuracy and sensitivity of the model.what's more,we also evaluate this new model in some samples(YH,hela,and two tumor samples).the result of assessment shows great improvement of accuracy and sensitivity.And just as the RED-ML,it is a software tool to do genome-wide RNA editing dectection (RED) based on RNA-seq data. All source codes and executables are located in the "bin" directory. The tool can be run on a Linux platform and the main program is red_ML.pl.
